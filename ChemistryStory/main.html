        <h1>Penguinius and the Three State of Matter</h1>
        
        <div id="container2">
            <p>Once upon a time, in a cold and icy world, lived a penguin named Penguinius. Penguinius loved learning about science and how the world around him worked. One day, while he was waddling on the ice, he saw something strange happening.</p>
            <p>He saw a snowman melting and turning into water! Penguinius was curious and went to investigate. He found out that the snowman was made of solid ice, and when it was heated by the sun, it turned into liquid water.</p>
            <p>Penguinius was amazed! He had learned about the three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. He knew that solids were things like ice and snow that had a fixed shape and didn't flow easily. Liquids were things like water that could flow and take the shape of their container. And gases were things like air that could fill up any space and didn't have a fixed shape.</p>
            <p>Penguinius decided to teach his penguin friends about the three states of matter. He told them the story of the snowman turning into water and explained how solids, liquids, and gases were all around them.</p>
            <p>Penguinius showed them how the particles in solids were tightly packed together, while the particles in liquids were looser and could slide past each other. He also explained how the particles in gases were very far apart and could move around freely.</p>
            <p>His penguin friends were amazed and wanted to learn more. So Penguinius took them on a journey to explore the different states of matter. They visited an ice rink to see how the ice skates slid on the solid ice, and they went to the beach to feel the sand and water on their feet.</p>
            <p>Penguinius even took them to a hot spring where they saw the steam rising up from the hot water, which was a gas. They had so much fun learning about the three states of matter and how they were all around them.</p>
            <p>And so, Penguinius and his penguin friends continued to learn and explore the world of science, always curious and fascinated by the wonders of the world.</p>
