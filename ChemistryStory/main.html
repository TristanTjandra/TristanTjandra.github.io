            <p>Once upon a time, in a cold and icy world, lived a penguin named Penguinius. Penguinius loved learning about science and how the world around him worked. One day, while he was waddling on the ice, he saw something strange happening.</p>
            <p>He saw a snowman melting and turning into water! Penguinius was curious and went to investigate. He found out that the snowman was made of solid ice, and when it was heated by the sun, it turned into liquid water.</p>
