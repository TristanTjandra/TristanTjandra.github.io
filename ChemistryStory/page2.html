            <p>Penguinius was amazed! He had learned about the three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. He knew that solids were things like ice and snow that had a fixed shape and didn't flow easily. Liquids were things like water that could flow and take the shape of their container. And gases were things like air that could fill up any space and didn't have a fixed shape.</p>
            <p>Penguinius decided to teach his penguin friends about the three states of matter. He told them the story of the snowman turning into water and explained how solids, liquids, and gases were all around them.</p>
