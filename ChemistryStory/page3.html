            <p>Penguinius showed them how the particles in solids were tightly packed together, while the particles in liquids were looser and could slide past each other. He also explained how the particles in gases were very far apart and could move around freely.</p>
            <p>His penguin friends were amazed and wanted to learn more. So Penguinius took them on a journey to explore the different states of matter. They visited an ice rink to see how the ice skates slid on the solid ice, and they went to the beach to feel the sand and water on their feet.</p>
