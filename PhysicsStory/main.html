          <h1>A Little Space Penguin Adventure</h1>
        </div>
        
        <p>Astro Pengu was a brave little penguin who lived on Earth. One day, he decided that he wanted to explore the galaxy and see what lay beyond our planet. So, he built himself a rocket and set off into space.</p>
          
          <p>As he flew away from Earth, Astro Pengu noticed that his rocket was moving faster and faster. He had heard the word "speed" before, but he wasn't exactly sure what it meant. So, he decided to ask his friend, the wise old owl, for help.</p>
    
        <p>"Owl," said Astro Pengu, "my rocket is going really fast, but I don't understand what speed means. Can you help me?"</p>

        <p>"Of course, my dear Astro Pengu," replied the owl. "Speed is how fast an object is moving. The faster it moves, the higher its speed."</p>

        <p>Astro Pengu nodded, starting to understand. "But how do I control my speed?" he asked.</p>

        <p>"Well," replied the owl, "you can control your speed by using your rocket's engines. If you want to go faster, you can increase the power of your engines. If you want to slow down, you can decrease the power. That's why you have those buttons on your dashboard!"</p>
