<h2>Conclusion</h2>
As a team, we learnt more than we could have imagined. We were exposed to a lot of challenges in all departments, but we managed to pull through and create a product we as a team were satisfied with. The project was a joy to make as we slowly see it formed from ground up. We hope this small project can be a starting point for bigger future projects.
