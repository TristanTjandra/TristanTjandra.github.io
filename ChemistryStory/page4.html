            <p>Penguinius even took them to a hot spring where they saw the steam rising up from the hot water, which was a gas. They had so much fun learning about the three states of matter and how they were all around them.</p>
            <p>And so, Penguinius and his penguin friends continued to learn and explore the world of science, always curious and fascinated by the wonders of the world.</p>
